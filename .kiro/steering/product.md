# Product Overview

Thesis is a structured debate platform where every post is a resolution and outcomes are determined by measured mind-changes rather than raw upvotes.

## Core Concept
- Users create debates with resolutions and take support/oppose sides
- 3-round structured format: Opening → Rebuttal → Closing
- Spectators record pre-read and post-read stances to measure persuasion
- "Persuasion delta" (mind changes) determines debate impact, not vote counts

## Key Differentiators
- Pre/post stance tracking for blind voting (prevents bandwagon effects)
- Argument impact scoring based on attributed stance changes
- Steelman Gate: Debaters must demonstrate understanding of opponent's position before rebuttals
- Market-style visualization of stance shifts over time

## North Star Metric
Persuasion delta — who changed minds, not who got the most votes

## User Roles
- Debaters: Create resolutions, submit arguments in turn-based rounds
- Spectators: Vote on stances, react to arguments, leave comments
- All users have reputation scores based on debate participation and prediction accuracy
